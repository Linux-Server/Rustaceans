/*
This is getting startde of rust book. It covers
1. Installing Rust on Linux, macOS, and Windows
2. Writing a program that prints Hello, world!
3. Using cargo, Rustâ€™s package manager and build system


////Writing and Running a Rust Program

1. Create a main.rs  source file in the getting started folder and paste hello world programs
2.the file name always end up with .rs extension
3.if ur file name has more than one word use underscore _ ex: hello_world.rs
4.Now save the file and rust the following command in terminal
``` rustc main.rs ```
5. which will generate a binary executable of the  progra
6. run the execubal ein any operating system
 ```
./main
 ```
 7. which will print the welcome message on your terminal


 /// ANATOMY OF RUST
 1. the main function is special , which will run first on every executable
 2. the func sig of main fn have no parameters and returns nothing
 3.the function body is wrapped around with curly braces
 4.if you want to stick with standard style we can use rustfmt which is installed by default with rust
 


*/

fn main() {
    // 1. Rust intentation should go with 4 spaces instead of 1 tab.
    //2. println! is rust macro which end with exclmation
    // each line should end with a semicolom
    println!("Welcome to getting started!");
}
