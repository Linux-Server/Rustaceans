/*
//DATA TYPES
1.Every value in rust is  a certain data type
2.data types are mainly two, scalar and compound data types
3.rust is statically typed language
4.it must know all the varibales at compile time
5.the compiler can usually infer data type based on the value we assign ti it
6. In some cases, developer need to annotate type, where compiler is unable to infer the data type

//SCALAR TYPES

1.
